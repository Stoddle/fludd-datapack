F.L.U.D.D datapack made by Stoddle.

This datapack periodically uses the actionbar to display information. I am not held accountable for any conflicts with other datapacks you have installed.
It may be recommended to use this datapack standalone to avoid any problems with other datapacks if you aren't sure what you are doing.
